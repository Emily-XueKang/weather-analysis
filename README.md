# Project 2 - Spatiotemporal Analysis with MapReduce

This repository includes starter files and a sample directory structure. You are welcome to use it or come up with your own project structure.

Project Specification: https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~mmalensek/courses/cs686/projects/project-2.html

# Deliverables

The project specification defines several questions that you will answer with MapReduce jobs. You should edit this document (README.md) with your answers as you find them, including figures, references, etc. This will also serve as a way of tracking your progress through the milestones.
